# My Developer's Resume as a Website

## Description

When I needed to make a resume to start applying to internships, I decided to make one as a website to
show employers a practical demonstration of my skills. That is why I decided to cram as many
web technologies that I could into one website. This project is a proof-of-concept of fast front-end
development using things like PUG, front-end frameworks, bundlers, and more. This project takes inspiration from
and reuses parts of the [Start Bootstrap - Resume](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-resume) project.
